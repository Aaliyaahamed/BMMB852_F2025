# Week 9 Assignment: Automate a large scale analysis
### Aaliya Ahamed • BMMB852 • 2025-10-26

This week's assignment automated the process of downloading, processing, and aligning high-throughput sequencing data. It used a Makefile to define the workflow for a single sample and leveraged GNU parallel to efficiently scale the analysis across multiple samples defined in a design.csv file.

The pipeline was based on the data from the paper on the 2014 Ebola virus, BioProject PRJNA257197.

1. Initial Sanity Check: A Single Run

It was strongly recommended to perform a test run on a single sample. This verified that all software dependencies were met and the configuration was correct before launching a large batch job. The command was executed from the project's root directory.
```bash
make all SRR=SRR1972976 SAMPLE=G1749.1 GENOME_ACC=AF086833 GENOME_NAME=ebola_zaire
```

_A successful execution resulted in the creation of genome/, reads/, and results/ directories containing the output for the G1749.1 sample_.

2. Full-Scale Analysis: Batch Processing

To process multiple samples, GNU parallel was used to iterate through the design.csv manifest and launch a make job for each entry.

Command to process the first 10 samples:
```bash

head -n 11 design.csv | parallel --colsep ',' --header : --lb -j  "make all SRR={SRR} SAMPLE={SampleName} GENOME_ACC=AF086833 GENOME_NAME=ebola_zaire"
```


# Directory Structure and Key Artifacts

After a successful run, the project folder was organized as follows, containing the key generated files:
```bash
